# @andriemc's dotfiles.
I was tired of manually reconfiguring my gitpod and other environments, so I made this.

`.bashrc` is appended to the end of your current `.bashrc` configuration, in a way that will hopefully prevent any issues.

### Usage
Simply just run the install (or bootstrap) script.

```bash
./install
```
